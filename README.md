This repository contains my configuration files (dotfiles) for ZSH, Vim, and TMUX, as well as scripts for setting up a development environment on macOS (Darwin).

## Installation:

To install these dotfiles, clone the repository and run the install script:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jglasovic/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

## TODO:
